###栈(Stack)和堆(Heap)
为什么堆栈总是被同时提及，而又傻傻分不清楚？在一般的中英词典中Stack(n. 堆；堆叠)和Heap(n. 堆；许多；累积)，都被翻译成堆，并没有出现栈这个词。而栈在中文词典里是“储存货物或供旅客住宿的房屋”的意思。所以推测译者是为了在中文里区分这两个“堆”而特意找的相近的词——“栈”。

那么在英文里Stack和Heap有什么区别呢？在朗文英语词典中，Stack意思是`a neat pile of things `，它指向了一个近义词Heap，意思是`a large untidy pile of things`。区别在于Stack是整齐地堆叠，Heap是一大物品的堆积，是不是有种恍然大悟的感觉，其实在中文翻译中已经有所体现，“叠”和“积”的差异。

在计算机领域，其实也存在

> Stacks in computing architectures are regions of memory where data is added or removed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.
In most modern computer systems, each thread has a reserved region of memory referred to as its stack. When a function executes, it may add some of its state data to the top of the stack; when the function exits it is responsible for removing that data from the stack. At a minimum, a thread's stack is used to store the location of function calls in order to allow return statements to return to the correct location, but programmers may further choose to explicitly use the stack. If a region of memory lies on the thread's stack, that memory is said to have been allocated on the stack.
Because the data is added and removed in a last-in-first-out manner, stack-based memory allocation is very simple and typically faster than heap-based memory allocation (also known as dynamic memory allocation). Another feature is that memory on the stack is automatically, and very efficiently, reclaimed when the function exits, which can be convenient for the programmer if the data is no longer required. If however, the data needs to be kept in some form, then it must be copied from the stack before the function exits. Therefore, stack based allocation is suitable for temporary data or data which is no longer required after the creating function exits. ------- from Wiki
