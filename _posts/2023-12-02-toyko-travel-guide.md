It's a busy and enriching trip in Toyko, all are fresh experiences for me as a foreigner. I'd like to share the itinerary with you for reference.

### Basic
- Transportation: Use the JR Tokyo Wide Pass as the main ticket for three days in the suburbs, and a 48-hour subway ticket for local transportation.
- Accommodation: Opt for capsule hotels located near the core areas as they offer excellent value for money.
- Dining: Dinning mainly at convenience store, and grab whatever you feel like eating when you're hungry.

### Itinerary:
- Day 1: Arrive at Narita Airport around noon and take the Airport Express Train directly to Shinjuku. After checking in, explore the shopping malls in Shinjuku.
- Day 2: Take the Fuji Excursion Line from Shinjuku and head to Lake Kawaguchi. Take a leisurely walk around the lake and enjoy the magnificent view of Mt. Fuji. Return to Shinjuku in the afternoon.
- Day 3: Take a train from Shinjuku to Kamakura and ride the Enoshima Electric Railway to admire the coastal scenery, including places like Hase Temple, the Great Buddha, and Kamakura High School. Return to Shinjuku on the same day.
- Day 4: In the morning, visit the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, which was featured in the film "The Garden of Words." In the afternoon, take the Shinkansen to Karuizawa, the destination of a wedding you're attending, and stay there for the day. Karuizawa offers skiing, autumn foliage, hot springs, and a huge outlet mall. If you prefer not to stay overnight, you can use the efficient Toyko Wide Pass to travel back and forth, or visit other nearby places of interest such as Izu Atami, Nikko, and Kinugawa. The three-day pass offers great value for money.
- Day 5: Travel from Karuizawa to Asakusa. Purchase a subway ticket and explore the city using the subway. Visit Senso-ji Temple and the Tokyo National Museum. In the evening, take a stroll in Akihabara, but note that most stores close early, around 8:00 PM, so plan your shopping time accordingly.
- Day 6: Visit Ueno Park, the Western Art Museum, Ameyoko Shopping Street, Jimbocho's old bookstores, and the Imperial Palace. The duration of the visit depends on your personal interests. If you didn't have enough time in Akihabara on the first day, you can continue exploring on this day.
- Day 7: Enjoy the last day of sightseeing, dining, and shopping. Visit the Tsukiji Fish Market, Ginza (Pokémon Center), Shibuya (Nintendo flagship store, and other similar Pokémon stores like the one in Ginza), Meiji Shrine in Shinjuku, and spend the night in Shinjuku.
- Day 8: Take a direct train from Shinjuku to Narita Airport, and indulge in some duty-free shopping at the airport. Conclude this fulfilling trip.
