If you are not interested in the text, you can visit the [Woop](https://drinking.github.io/boop-web/ ) directly. Any questions about the use of the product, please check the documentation on the product page or leave feedback.

### Why built Woop

Woop is inspired by Boop - an open source text processing Mac App. Its function is very clear, receive user text data, impose methods to convert into the target text. Because of its single responsibility, simple and fast operation, and the ability to load their own developed scripts, Boop is so widely liked by users.

However, Boop can only be used on the Mac platform, so there is no way to enjoy the convenience of Boop when working on other platforms. So the idea of making a cross-platform Boop came up. So we have Woop(Web+Boop) - a cross-platform text processing web application.

### Take a first look

The following is a simple example that shows the complete flow of the Woop product. The text is entered in lowercase, converted by the UpperCase method, and the final text is output below. User can choose the desired method for simple usage scenarios. However, in complex work scenarios, simple methods are often not available in one step. So Woop makes some improvements in the process.

### Combine method

Although a method is simple, it is possible to achieve more complex through method combination. Text is like raw material on an assembly line, which is processed in different steps to take shape. For example, the text has been capitalized -> sorted -> comma spliced in three ways to reach its final form. Although Woop can't do everything, by providing enough basic methods, it is expected to be like organizing Lego to combine the target methods close to the user's expectations.

### Parameter

In order to reuse and satisfy various scenarios, the support of parameters is necessary. For example, in the figure below, the first line is the parameter, and it extracts the data in the second column. While there are many command line tools for developers to accomplish the same and more complex requirements, Woop is intended to cover the common scenarios. The parameters are not as intuitive to use and understand, and there still needs some improvement.

### Redirect

Redirect is to convert the current output to input and to clear the currently selected method. This is because of the incompatible logic between methods, some need parameters while others not. Therefore, in order to use the keyboard insted of mouse, Redirect is introduced. 

### Feature

Woop is a static page deployed on a Github Page, all its methods running on client browser safely. The idea of data flow is inspired by Boop and Serverless, it only needs to add new method to meet the daily requirement. Subsequently, Parsers for schema or other formats is on the way. Templates is also welcome if there is requirement. Or introduce some practical leetcode algorithm. 

In short, the idea of Woop is simple, purely reflect the relationship between data and method, and I hope you will like it.
